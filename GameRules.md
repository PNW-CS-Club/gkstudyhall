<ins>**The dice:**</ins> your standard six-sided dice.

## Player Turns

_(How is turn order decided?)_

Each turn consists of a few phases:

### The Trait Roll

At the start of each turn, the current player performs their _trait roll_ by rolling the dice. The roll's value determines what happens next:

- 1, 2, 3, 4: Trait Effect
- 5: Battle
- 6: Lose turn

<ins>**Trait Effect:**</ins> If your trait roll is between 1 and 4, you trigger the effect on your character card that corresponds to the dice value.
There is an assortment of various trait abilities between the different characters, so experiment and see which traits you take a liking to.

<ins>**Battle:**</ins> Upon rolling a 5, you will enter combat against an opponent of your choice. 
In a battle, each player rolls a dice. The player who rolls lower takes damage equal to the rolls' difference.

In the case of a tie, the stakes are raised. The combatants reroll and the damage taken is doubled.
If they tie again, they reroll again, with the damage taken instead tripled, and so on.

<ins>**Lose Turn:**</ins> The unlucky player who rolls a 6 must forfeit the rest of their turn.
